## Catbot Setup

Setup scripts for  cat-bots (cathook navbots)

You must type one of the commands in your terminal that support your distribution to make it work.

After the install script finished successfully, the navmesh files have to be moved into your tf2 maps directory.  
They can be found [here](https://github.com/Yayo443/catbot-database).
